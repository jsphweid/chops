```bash
# gets some a round of free problems to choose from, then you just enter any LC slug name (probably one from the list)
./lc.sh new

# once you recieve a problem, either sublime or TextEdit will pop up (yes you have to be Mac for now)

# problem instructions will appear in the terminal along with information on how to submit it from the terminal
```
